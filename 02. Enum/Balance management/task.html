<h2>Balance management</h2>

<p><br>
    You are given the enum <code>Operation</code> and the class <code>Account</code>. Their implementations are shown
    below.</p>
<p>The <code>Operation</code> enum:</p>
<pre><code>enum Operation {
    /**
     * deposit (add) an amount into an Account
     */
    DEPOSIT,
    /**
     * withdraw (subtract) an amount from an Account
     */
    WITHDRAW
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Account</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>class Account {

    private String code;
    private Long balance;

    public String getCode() {
        return code;
    }

    public Long getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(Long balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
} </code></pre>
<p>Your task is to implement the method <code>changeBalance</code><strong> </strong>to control balances. It has the
    following declaration:</p>
<pre><code>public static boolean changeBalance(Account account, Operation operation, Long sum)</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>If the given operation is DEPOSIT the method adds the sum to the account's balance.</li>
    <li>If the operation is WITHDRAW the method subtracts the given sum from the account's balance. If the given sum is
        greater than the balance, the method shouldn't change it. Instead, the method must output the string <strong>"Not
            enough money to withdraw."</strong> (without quotes, don't forget the full point).
    </li>
    <li>In any case, the method returns a <strong>boolean value</strong> â€” <code>true</code> if the balance has changed,
        <code>false</code> if it hasn't.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>The following values are passed to the method: <code>operation = Operation.DEPOSIT</code>, <code>sum = 2000</code>.
    The initial balance of the account is <code>1000</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, the method returns <code>true</code> and the new account balance is <code>3000</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>The following values are passed to the method: <code>operation = Operation.WITHDRAW</code>, <code>sum = 5000</code>.
    The initial balance of the account is <code>2000</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, the method returns <code>false</code>, the account's balance is not changed (<code>2000</code>) and
    method prints <code>"Not enough money to withdraw."</code>.</p>
